# Appendix C - Voltage Probe

The Differential Voltage Probe is designed for exploring the basic principles of electricity. Use this probe to measure voltage in low voltage AC and DC circuits. With a range ±5 V or ±30 V, this system is ideal for use in "battery and bulb" circuits. Use it with the Current Probe to explore Ohm's law, phase relationships in reactive components and much more.  Use multiple sensors to explore series and parallel circuits. This sensor has the same characteristics as the Voltage Probe from the Vernier Current and Voltage Probe System.

#### How the Differential Voltage Probe Works

The Differential Voltage Probe measures the potential difference between the V+clip (red) and the V- clip (black). The voltage probes have differential inputs. The voltage measured is with respect to the black clip and not circuit ground. This allows you to measure directly across circuit elements without the constraints of common grounding. The voltage probes can be used to measure negative potentials, as well as positive potentials. This is a nice improvement for people using one of our 0 to 5 volt interfaces. The voltage probes are designed to be used like voltmeter leads. They should be placed across a circuit element. The differential input range is -5 volts to +5 volts. Over-voltage protection is provided so that slightly higher voltages will not damage the sensor. You should NEVER use high voltages or household AC with these probes.

#### Do I Need to Calibrate the Differential Voltage Probe? "No"

You should not have to perform a new calibration when using the Differential Voltage Probe in the classroom.
