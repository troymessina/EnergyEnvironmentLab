# Appendix D - Microphone

The Microphone can be used for a variety of activities with sound waves:

- Demonstrate how the wave pattern changes when frequency and amplitude are changed
- Compare the waveforms from various musical instruments
- Have students capture the waveform of the sound of a tuning fork and model the sine wave using a function
- Measure the speed of sound by using reflected sound waves in a tube
- Demonstrate beat patterns
- Determine the period and then the frequency of a sound by measuring the time between peaks on the waveform
- Display the fast Fourier transform (FFT) of a sound

## Setting up the Microphone for Spectrum Analysis

This sensor is used with Capstone and a computer. Here is the general procedure to follow when using the Microphone:

1. Connect the Microphone Probe to the interface.
2. Click the Sensor Data menu and select FFT.
3. Turn on the sensor by pressing the power button until the lights turn on.
4. Select the sensor that matches the device ID printed on your sensor.
5. Click Hardware Setup  in the Tools palette to close the Hardware Setup panel.
